# Neural Network
This project represents a single layer neural network that can update synaptic weights base on the given input and output values using the sigmoid function
# Description
User gives the program a set of input of 0s and 1s, and followed by their corresponding outputs in 1s and 0s.
The program then uses the sigmoid function to adjust the synaptic weights so it's predicted outputs will nearly equal to the given outputs.
The user then throw in a new set of input without the given output, and the program will predict the output for that set of inputs.
